This is an integration of LLM APIs presented through Discord.

Lets start with an overview:  I grew up playing text based adventures. Zork was an early entry into what feels like a conversational interaction. Fast forward many years, and we are experiencing the infantcy of Large Language Models. With all of the rapid advancements, I wanted a tool that can test different LLMs and incorporate new models as they become available. Instead of trying to create a new front end, it feels much more sensible to utilize as best-in-breed approach, and incorporate the functionality into a UI/UX that has already been matured. Currently Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Discord all have large user bases.  For this project, Discord's Python library was the easiest one for me to use and had most of the functionality that I wanted.
